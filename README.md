# TFReview üîç

View your Terraform plan in an beautiful and easy to use HTML interface.

Staring at reams of monospace text in a terminal is so 1985. Let TFReview blast your terraform experience into a modern future! (the late 90s)

Pipe your terraform plan output to it and it will open something readable by humans in a browser: `terraform plan | tfreview`

## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

- [ ] **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Action to run and post results to a PR as clickable comment
- [ ] **Easier installation**: Definitely want to switch to `uv` but the AI barely understands `uv`. Maybe I just ask it to rewrite it in Go.

# Credits
Built entirely with AI in Cursor using plain english. The code quality matches my will to live after reviewing thousands of Terraform plans manually. Technically functional but deeply concerning. You're welcome.

Seriously though, as horribly frustrating vibe coding is, I never would have built this myself without it. Vibe coding solved a long standing problem for me for $20/month (+ some mental anguish).
